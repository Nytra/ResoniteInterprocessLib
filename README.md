A BepInEx plugin for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that loads MonkeyLoader. You must have already installed the [MonkeyLoader Resonite GamePack](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.GamePacks.Resonite) for this to work properly.

## Installation (Manual)
1. Install [BepisLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader) for Resonite.
2. Download the latest release ZIP file (e.g., `Nytra-MonkeyLoaderLoader-1.0.0.zip`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/Nytra/MonkeyLoaderLoader-BepInEx/releases) page.
3. Extract the ZIP and copy the `plugins` folder to your BepInEx folder in your Resonite installation directory:
   - **Default location:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\BepInEx\`
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your BepInEx logs.
